# Arcade-Game
Why This Project? Games have a lot of objects and those objects do a lot of different things; but sometimes they do some very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences your application architecture and provides performance optimization.  What Did I Learn? I  learned JavaScriptâ€™s object oriented programming features to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects. I also discovered a variety of ways inheritance and delegation can be used to create well architected and performant applications.
